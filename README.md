### About Me

I have ten years professional iOS development experience from startups to Fortune 500 companies. Owner of [Fleuronic LLC](fleuronic.com), a single person development shop. I apply a thoughtful and rigorous approach to engineering up and down the stack, in codebases both established and yet to be, to build something people love.
