### Hi, Iâ€™m Jordan ðŸ‘‹

With ten years professional iOS development experience from startups to Fortune 500 companies, I started [Fleuronic LLC](fleuronic.com), a single person development shop, in 2019. I strive to apply a thoughtful and rigorous approach to engineering up and down the stack, in codebases both established and yet to be, to build something people love.
